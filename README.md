# SustainTulsaII

**SustainTulsaII** is an upgrade created using React and the MERN stack. The site is a digital hub connecting the Tulsa, Oklahoma community with sustainable businesses, events, and initiatives. Our mission is to empower individuals, families, and businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices and support sustainability in everyday life. SustainTulsaII also advocates for sustainable food programs in schools to address food insecurity among children.
